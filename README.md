# Stochastic_Simulation_Group50
Assignments and analysis scripts for the course Stochastic Simulation by Group 50


## First analysis results online

Running the Monte Carlo, the Latin Hypercube and the Orthogonal sampling methods with s = 4096, i = 1 to 10000 by 10.


Results: 

.csv files, every column (but the first and the last one) corresponds to one run of the samplers with a given number iterations, Every column is a new estimate for the area of the Mandelbrot. 

df_conv_MC/LHC/OS.csv files contains the variable |A_is - A_js| for all j < i.

## Second analysis results online

I ran the three samplers with 100489 samples and 2000 iteration 100 times the resulting files can be reached from:
